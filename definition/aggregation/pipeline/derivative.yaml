doc: |
    A parent pipeline aggregation which calculates the derivative of a specified metric in a parent
    histogram (or date_histogram) aggregation. The specified metric must be numeric and the
    enclosing histogram must have min_doc_count set to 0 (default for histogram aggregations).
parameters:
    buckets_path:
        type: str
        required: True
        doc: |
            The path to the buckets we wish to find the average for.

            See: [bucket path syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-pipeline.html#buckets-path-syntax)
    gap_policy:
        type: str
        default: skip
        doc: |
            The policy to apply when gaps are found in the data.

            See: [gap policy](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-pipeline.html#gap-policy)
    format:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Format to apply to the output value of this aggregation
    units:
        type: str
        doc: |
            The derivative aggregation allows the units of the derivative values to be specified.
            This returns an extra field in the response normalized_value which reports the
            derivative value in the desired x-axis units.
returns: ['value']
