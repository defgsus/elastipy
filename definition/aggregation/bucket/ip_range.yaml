    Just like the dedicated [date range](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-daterange-aggregation.html) aggregation, there is also a dedicated range aggregation for IP typed fields:
parameters:
    field:
        type: str
        required: True
        doc: |
            The IPv4 field
    ranges:
        type: Sequence[Union[Mapping[str, str], str]]
        required: True
        ranges: True
        doc: |
            List of ranges to define the buckets, either as straight IPv4 or as CIDR masks.

            Example:
                [
                    {"to": "10.0.0.5"},
                    {"from": "10.0.0.5", "to": "10.0.0.127"},
                    {"from": "10.0.0.127"},
                ]

            Alternatively this parameter can be a list of strings. The above example can be rewritten as:
                ["10.0.0.5", "10.0.0.127"]
    keyed:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            Setting the keyed flag to true associates a unique string key with each bucket and returns the ranges as a hash rather than an array.
