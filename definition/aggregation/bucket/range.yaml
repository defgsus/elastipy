doc: |
    A multi-bucket value source based aggregation that enables the user to define a set of
    ranges - each representing a bucket. During the aggregation process, the values extracted
    from each document will be checked against each bucket range and "bucket" the
    relevant/matching document.

    Note: Note that this aggregation includes the from value and excludes the to value for each range.
parameters:
    ranges:
        type: Sequence[Union[Mapping[str, Any], Any]]
        required: True
        ranges: True
        doc: |
            List of ranges to define the buckets

            Example:

            ```
                [
                    {"to": 10},
                    {"from": 10, "to": 20},
                    {"from": 20},
                ]
            ```

            Alternatively this parameter can be a list of strings. The above example can be rewritten as:
                `[10, 20]`

            Note: This aggregation includes the from value and excludes the to value for each range.

    keyed:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            Setting the keyed flag to true associates a unique string key with each bucket
            and returns the ranges as a hash rather than an array.
