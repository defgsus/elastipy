doc: |
    A multi-bucket aggregation that works on geo_point fields and groups points into buckets that represent
    cells in a grid. The resulting grid can be sparse and only contains cells that have matching data.
    Each cell corresponds to a
    [map tile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map) as used by many online map sites.
    Each cell is labeled using a "{zoom}/{x}/{y}" format, where zoom is equal to the user-specified precision.

        - High precision keys have a larger range for x and y, and represent tiles that cover only a small area.

        - Low precision keys have a smaller range for x and y, and represent tiles that each cover a large area.

    Warning: The highest-precision geotile of length 29 produces cells that cover less than
    a 10cm by 10cm of land and so high-precision requests can be very costly in terms of RAM
    and result sizes. Please first filter the aggregation to a smaller geographic area before
    requesting high-levels of detail.

parameters:
    field:
        type: str
        required: True
        doc: |
            The specified field must be of type geo_point (which can only be set explicitly in the mappings).
            And it can also hold an array of geo_point fields, in which case all will be taken
            into account during aggregation.
    precision:
        type: Union[int, str]
        default: 7
        doc: |
            The required precision of the grid in the range [1, 29]. Higher means more precise.

            Note: When requesting detailed buckets (typically for displaying a "zoomed in" map) a filter like
            [geo_bounding_box](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-geo-bounding-box-query.html)
            should be applied to narrow the subject area otherwise potentially millions of
            buckets will be created and returned.
    bounds:
        type: Mapping
        doc: |
            The geotile_grid aggregation supports an optional bounds parameter that restricts the
            points considered to those that fall within the bounds provided. The bounds parameter accepts the
            bounding box in all the same
            [accepted formats](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-geo-bounding-box-query.html#query-dsl-geo-bounding-box-query-accepted-formats)
            of the bounds specified in the Geo Bounding Box Query. This bounding box can be used with
            or without an additional `geo_bounding_box` query filtering the points prior to aggregating.
            It is an independent bounding box that can intersect with, be equal to, or be disjoint to any
            additional geo_bounding_box queries defined in the context of the aggregation.
    size:
        type: int
        default: 10000
        doc: |
            The maximum number of geohash buckets to return (defaults to 10,000).
            When results are trimmed, buckets are prioritised based on the volumes of documents they contain.
    shard_size:
        type: int
        doc: |
            To allow for more accurate counting of the top cells returned in the final result
            the aggregation defaults to returning `max(10, (size x number-of-shards))` buckets from each shard.
            If this heuristic is undesirable, the number considered from each shard can be
            over-ridden using this parameter.
