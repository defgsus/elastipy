doc: |
    A multi-bucket aggregation similar to the Date histogram except instead of providing an interval
    to use as the width of each bucket, a target number of buckets is provided indicating the
    number of buckets needed and the interval of the buckets is automatically chosen to
    best achieve that target. The number of buckets returned will always be less than
    or equal to this target number.
    
    The buckets field is optional, and will default to 10 buckets if not specified.
parameters:
    field:
        type: str
        timestamp: True
    buckets:
        type: int
        default: 10
        doc: |
            The number of buckets that are to be returned.
    minimum_interval:
        type: str
        doc: |
            The minimum_interval allows the caller to specify the minimum rounding interval
            that should be used. This can make the collection process more efficient,
            as the aggregation will not attempt to round at any interval lower than minimum_interval.
            
            The accepted units for minimum_interval are:
                year, month, day, hour, minute, second
    time_zone:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Date-times are stored in Elasticsearch in UTC. By default, all bucketing and rounding
            is also done in UTC. The `time_zone` parameter can be used to indicate that
            bucketing should use a different time zone.

            Time zones may either be specified as an ISO 8601 UTC offset (e.g. `+01:00` or `-08:00`)
            or as a timezone id, an identifier used in the TZ database like America/Los_Angeles.

            Warning:
                When using time zones that follow DST (daylight savings time) changes,
                buckets close to the moment when those changes happen can have slightly
                different sizes than neighbouring buckets. For example, consider a DST
                start in the CET time zone: on 27 March 2016 at 2am, clocks were turned
                forward 1 hour to 3am local time. If the result of the aggregation was daily
                buckets, the bucket covering that day will only hold data for 23 hours
                instead of the usual 24 hours for other buckets. The same is true for
                shorter intervals like e.g. 12h. Here, we will have only a 11h bucket on
                the morning of 27 March when the DST shift happens.
    format:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Specifies the format of the 'key_as_string' response.
            See: [mapping date format](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-date-format.html)
    keyed:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            Setting the keyed flag to true associates a unique string key with each bucket and
            returns the ranges as a hash rather than an array.
    missing:
        type: Any
        doc: |
            The missing parameter defines how documents that are missing a value should
            be treated. By default they will be ignored but it is also possible to treat them
            as if they had a value.

        type: dict
