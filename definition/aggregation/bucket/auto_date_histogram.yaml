doc: |
    A multi-bucket aggregation similar to the Date histogram except instead of providing an interval to use as the width of each bucket, a target number of buckets is provided indicating the number of buckets needed and the interval of the buckets is automatically chosen to best achieve that target. The number of buckets returned will always be less than or equal to this target number.
    
    The buckets field is optional, and will default to 10 buckets if not specified.
parameters:
    field:
        type: str
        timestamp: True
    buckets:
        type: int
        default: 10
        doc: |
            The number of buckets that are to be returned.
    minimum_interval:
        type: str
        doc: |
            The minimum_interval allows the caller to specify the minimum rounding interval that should be used. This can make the collection process more efficient, as the aggregation will not attempt to round at any interval lower than minimum_interval.
            
            The accepted units for minimum_interval are:
                year, month, day, hour, minute, second
    time_zone:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Elasticsearch stores date-times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). By default, all bucketing and rounding is also done in UTC. Use the time_zone parameter to indicate that bucketing should use a different time zone.
            
            For example, if the interval is a calendar day and the time zone is America/New_York then 2020-01-03T01:00:01Z is : # Converted to 2020-01-02T18:00:01 # Rounded down to 2020-01-02T00:00:00 # Then converted back to UTC to produce 2020-01-02T05:00:00:00Z # Finally, when the bucket is turned into a string key it is printed in America/New_York so itâ€™ll display as "2020-01-02T00:00:00"
            
            It looks like: bucket_key = localToUtc(Math.floor(utcToLocal(value) / interval) * interval))
            
            You can specify time zones as an ISO 8601 UTC offset (e.g. +01:00 or -08:00) or as an IANA time zone ID, such as America/Los_Angeles.
    format:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Specifies the format of the 'key_as_string' response.
            See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-date-format.html
    keyed:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            Setting the keyed flag to true associates a unique string key with each bucket and returns the ranges as a hash rather than an array.
    missing:
        type: Any
        doc: |
            The missing parameter defines how documents that are missing a value should be treated. By default they will be ignored but it is also possible to treat them as if they had a value.

        type: dict
