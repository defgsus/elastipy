    Like the `sampler` aggregation this is a filtering aggregation used to limit any sub aggregations'
    processing to a sample of the top-scoring documents. The `diversified_sampler` aggregation adds the ability
    to limit the number of matches that share a common value such as an "author".

    Note: Any good market researcher will tell you that when working with samples of data it is
    important that the sample represents a healthy variety of opinions rather than being skewed by any
    single voice. The same is true with aggregations and sampling with these diversify settings can
    offer a way to remove the bias in your content (an over-populated geography, a large spike in
    a timeline or an over-active forum spammer).

    Example use cases:

        - Tightening the focus of analytics to high-relevance matches rather than the potentially
        very long tail of low-quality matches
        - Removing bias from analytics by ensuring fair representation of content from different sources
        - Reducing the running cost of aggregations that can produce useful results using
        only samples e.g. significant_terms

    A choice of field or script setting is used to provide values used for de-duplication and the
    `max_docs_per_value` setting controls the maximum number of documents collected on any one shard
    which share a common value. The default setting for `max_docs_per_value` is 1.

    Note: The aggregation will throw an error if the choice of field or script produces multiple values
    for a single document (de-duplication using multi-valued fields is not supported due to efficiency concerns).

    [Limitations:](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-diversified-sampler-aggregation.html#_limitations_5)

        Cannot be nested under breadth_first aggregations
            Being a quality-based filter the diversified_sampler aggregation needs access to the relevance
            score produced for each document. It therefore cannot be nested under a terms aggregation which has the
            collect_mode switched from the default depth_first mode to breadth_first as this discards scores.
            In this situation an error will be thrown.

        Limited de-dup logic.
            The de-duplication logic applies only at a shard level so will not apply across shards.

        No specialized syntax for geo/date fields
            Currently the syntax for defining the diversifying values is defined by a choice of
            field or script - there is no added syntactical sugar for expressing geo or date units
            such as `"7d"` (7 days). This support may be added in a later release and users will
            currently have to create these sorts of values using a script.

parameters:
    field:
        type: str
        doc: |
            The field to search on. Can alternatively be a script
    script:
        type: Mapping
        doc: |
            The script that specifies the aggregation. Can alternatively be a 'field'
    shard_size:
        type: int
        default: 100
        doc: |
            The shard_size parameter limits how many top-scoring documents are collected in the sample processed on each shard. The default value is 100.
    max_docs_per_value:
        type: int
        default: 1
        doc: |
            The max_docs_per_value is an optional parameter and limits how many documents are permitted per choice of de-duplicating value. The default setting is 1.
