doc: |
    A filtering aggregation used to limit any sub aggregations' processing to a sample of the top-scoring documents.

    Example use cases:
        - Tightening the focus of analytics to high-relevance matches rather than the potentially very long tail of low-quality matches
        - Reducing the running cost of aggregations that can produce useful results using only samples e.g. significant_terms
parameters:
    shard_size:
        type: int
        default: 100
        doc: |
            The shard_size parameter limits how many top-scoring documents are collected in the sample processed on each shard. The default value is 100.
