doc: |
    A bucket aggregation returning a form of adjacency matrix. The request provides a collection of named filter expressions, similar to the filters aggregation request. Each bucket in the response represents a non-empty cell in the matrix of intersecting filters.

    The matrix is said to be symmetric so we only return half of it. To do this we sort the filter name strings and always use the lowest of a pair as the value to the left of the "&" separator.
parameters:
    filters:
        type: Mapping[str, Union[Mapping, 'QueryInterface']]
        required: True
    separator:
        type: str
        doc: |
            An alternative separator parameter can be passed in the request if clients wish to use a separator string other than the default of the ampersand.
