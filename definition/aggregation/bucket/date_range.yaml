doc: |
    A range aggregation that is dedicated for date values. The main difference between this aggregation and the normal [range](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-range-aggregation.html) aggregation is that the from and to values can be expressed in [Date Math](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/common-options.html#date-math) expressions, and it is also possible to specify a date format by which the from and to response fields will be returned. Note that this aggregation includes the from value and excludes the to value for each range.
parameters:
    ranges:
        type: Sequence[Union[Mapping[str, str], str]]
        required: True
        ranges: True
        doc: |
            List of ranges to define the buckets

            Example:
                [
                    {"to": "1970-01-01"},
                    {"from": "1970-01-01", "to": "1980-01-01"},
                    {"from": "1980-01-01"},
                ]

            Instead of date values any [Date Math](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/common-options.html#date-math) expression can be used as well.

            Alternatively this parameter can be a list of strings. The above example can be rewritten as:
                ["1970-01-01", "1980-01-01"]

            Note: This aggregation includes the from value and excludes the to value for each range.
    field:
        type: str
        doc: |
            The date field
        timestamp: True
    format:
        type: str
        doc: |
            The format of the response bucket keys as available for the [DateTimeFormatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html)
    time_zone:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Dates can be converted from another time zone to UTC by specifying the time_zone parameter.

            Time zones may either be specified as an ISO 8601 UTC offset (e.g. +01:00 or -08:00) or as one of the time zone ids from the TZ database.

            The time_zone parameter is also applied to rounding in date math expressions.
    keyed:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            Setting the keyed flag to true associates a unique string key with each bucket and returns the ranges as a hash rather than an array.
    missing:
        type: Any
        doc: |
            The missing parameter defines how documents that are missing a value should be treated. By default they will be ignored but it is also possible to treat them as if they had a value.
    script:
        type: dict
