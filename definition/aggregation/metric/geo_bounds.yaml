    A metric aggregation that computes the bounding box containing all geo values for a field.

    The Geo Bounds Aggregation is also supported on geo_shape fields.

    If wrap_longitude is set to true (the default), the bounding box can overlap the
    international date line and return a bounds where the top_left longitude is
    larger than the top_right longitude.

    For example, the upper right longitude will typically be greater than the lower
    left longitude of a geographic bounding box. However, when the area crosses
    the 180Â° meridian, the value of the lower left longitude will be greater than
    the value of the upper right longitude.
