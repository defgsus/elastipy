doc: |
    A single-value metrics aggregation that computes the weighted average of numeric values that are
    extracted from the aggregated documents. These values can be extracted either from
    specific numeric fields in the documents.

    When calculating a regular average, each datapoint has an equal "weight" …​ it contributes
    equally to the final value. Weighted averages, on the other hand, weight each datapoint differently.
    The amount that each datapoint contributes to the final value is extracted from the document, or provided by a script.

    As a formula, a weighted average is the `∑(value * weight) / ∑(weight)`

    A regular average can be thought of as a weighted average where every value has an implicit weight of 1
