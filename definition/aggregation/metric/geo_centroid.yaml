doc: |
    A metric aggregation that computes the weighted [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid) from all coordinate values for geo fields.

    The centroid metric for geo-shapes is more nuanced than for points. The centroid of a specific aggregation bucket containing shapes is the centroid of the highest-dimensionality shape type in the bucket. For example, if a bucket contains shapes comprising of polygons and lines, then the lines do not contribute to the centroid metric. Each type of shape’s centroid is calculated differently. Envelopes and circles ingested via the [Circle](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest-circle-processor.html) are treated as polygons.

    Warning: Using geo_centroid as a sub-aggregation of geohash_grid
        The geohash_grid aggregation places documents, not individual geo-points, into buckets. If a document’s geo_point field contains multiple values, the document could be assigned to multiple buckets, even if one or more of its geo-points are outside the bucket boundaries.

        If a geocentroid sub-aggregation is also used, each centroid is calculated using all geo-points in a bucket, including those outside the bucket boundaries. This can result in centroids outside of bucket boundaries.
