parameters:
    docvalue_fields:
        type: Sequence[Union[str, Mapping[str, str]]]
        doc: |
            Array of wildcard (`*`) patterns. The request returns doc values for field names
            matching these patterns in the `hits.fields` property of the response.

            You can specify items in the array as a string or object.
            See [Doc value fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-fields.html#docvalue-fields).

            Properties of `docvalue_fields` objects:

                - `field`
                (Required, string) Wildcard pattern. The request returns doc values for field names
                matching this pattern.
                - `format`
                (Optional, string) Format in which the doc values are returned.

                For [date fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/date.html),
                you can specify a
                [date format](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-date-format.html9.
                For [numeric fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/number.html),
                you can specify a [DecimalFormat pattern](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html).

            For other field data types, this parameter is not supported.
    fields:
        type: Sequence[Union[str, Mapping[str, str]]]
        doc: |
            Array of wildcard (`*`) patterns. The request returns values for field names matching
            these patterns in the `hits.fields` property of the response.

            You can specify items in the array as a string or object.
            See [Fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-fields.html#search-fields-param)
            for more details.

            Properties of `fields` objects:

                - `field`
                (Required, string) Wildcard pattern. The request returns values for field names matching this pattern.
                - `format´

                (Optional, string) Format in which the values are returned.

                The date fields date and date_nanos accept a date format. Spatial fields accept either geojson for GeoJSON (the default) or wkt for Well Known Text.

                For other field data types, this parameter is not supported.
    explain:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            If `true`, returns detailed information about score computation as part of a hit. Defaults to `false`.
    from:
        type: int
        default: 0
        doc: |
          Starting document offset. Defaults to `0`.

          By default, you cannot page through more than `10,000` hits using the from and size parameters.
          To page through more hits, use the `search_after` parameter.
    indices_boost:
        type: Sequence[Mapping[str, float]]
        doc: |
          Boosts the `_score` of documents from specified indices.

          Properties of `indices_boost` objects:

              `<index>: <boost-value>`

                  - `<index>` is the name of the index or index alias. Wildcard (´*`) expressions are supported.
                  - `<boost-value>` is the `float` factor by which scores are multiplied.

              A boost value greater than `1.0` increases the score.
              A boost value between `0` and `1.0` decreases the score.
    min_score:
        type: float
        doc: |
            Minimum `_score` for matching documents. Documents with a lower `_score` are not
          included in the search results.
    seq_no_primary_term:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            If `true`, returns sequence number and primary term of the last modification of each hit.
            See [Optimistic concurrency control](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/optimistic-concurrency-control.html).
    size:
        type: int
        default: 10
        doc: |
            Defines the number of hits to return. Defaults to `10`.

            By default, you cannot page through more than `10,000` hits using the from and size parameters.
            To page through more hits, use the
            [search_after](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/paginate-search-results.html#search-after)
            parameter.
    _source:
        type: Union[bool, str]
        default: True
        doc: |
            Indicates which [source fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-source-field.html)
            are returned for matching documents. These fields are returned in the `hits._source´ property
            of the search response. Defaults to `true`.

            Valid values:

                - `true` (Boolean) The entire document source is returned.
                - `false` (Boolean) The document source is not returned.
                - `<wildcard_pattern>`
                (string or array of strings) Wildcard (`*`) pattern or array of patterns containing source fields to return.
                - `<object>`
                Object containing a list of source fields to include or exclude.
                Properties for <object>

                    - `excludes`
                    (string or array of strings) Wildcard (`*`) pattern or array of patterns containing source fields
                    to exclude from the response.
                    You can also use this property to exclude fields from the subset specified in includes property.
                    - `includes`
                    (string or array of strings) Wildcard (`*`) pattern or array of patterns containing source
                    fields to return.
                    If this property is specified, only these source fields are returned. You can exclude
                    fields from this subset using the `excludes` property.
    stats:
        type: Sequence[str]
        doc: |
            Stats groups to associate with the search. Each group maintains a statistics aggregation
            for its associated searches. You can retrieve these stats using the
            [indices stats API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html).
    terminate_after:
        type: int
        default: 0
        doc: |
            The maximum number of documents to collect for each shard,
            upon reaching which the query execution will terminate early.

            Defaults to `0`, which does not terminate query execution early.
        timeout:
          type: str
          doc: |
              Specifies the period of time to wait for a response in
              [time units](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/common-options.html#time-units).
              If no response is received before the timeout expires,
              the request fails and returns an error. Defaults to no timeout.
