doc: |
    Returns documents that match a provided text, number, date or boolean value. The provided text is analyzed before matching.
    
    The match query is the standard query for performing a full-text search, including options for fuzzy matching.
parameters:
    field:
        type: str
        required: True
        top_level: True
        doc: |
            Field you wish to search.
    query:
        type: [str, int, float, bool]
        required: True
        doc: |
            Text, number, boolean value or date you wish to find in the provided <field>.
            
            The match query analyzes any provided text before performing a search. This means the match query can search text fields for analyzed tokens rather than an exact term.
    auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query:
        type: bool
        default: True
        doc: |
            If true, match phrase queries are automatically created for multi-term synonyms. Defaults to true.
    fuzziness:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Maximum edit distance allowed for matching. See Fuzziness for valid values and more information. See Fuzziness in the match query for an example.
    max_expansions:
        type: int
        default: 50
        doc: |
            Maximum number of terms to which the query will expand. Defaults to 50. 
    prefix_length:
        type: int
        default: 0
        doc: |
            Number of beginning characters left unchanged for fuzzy matching. Defaults to 0. 
    fuzzy_transpositions:
        type: bool
        default: True
        doc: |
            If true, edits for fuzzy matching include transpositions of two adjacent characters (ab â†’ ba). Defaults to true.
    fuzzy_rewrite:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Method used to rewrite the query. See the rewrite parameter for valid values and more information.
            
            If the fuzziness parameter is not 0, the match query uses a fuzzy_rewrite method of top_terms_blended_freqs_${max_expansions} by default.
    lenient:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            If true, format-based errors, such as providing a text query value for a numeric field, are ignored. Defaults to false. 
    operator:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Boolean logic used to interpret text in the query value. Valid values are:
                OR (Default)
                    For example, a query value of capital of Hungary is interpreted as capital OR of OR Hungary. 
                AND
                    For example, a query value of capital of Hungary is interpreted as capital AND of AND Hungary. 
    minimum_should_match:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Minimum number of clauses that must match for a document to be returned. See the minimum_should_match parameter for valid values and more information.
    zero_terms_query:
        type: str
        default: none
        doc: |
            Indicates whether no documents are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens, such as when using a stop filter. Valid values are:
                none (Default)
                    No documents are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens.
                all
                    Returns all documents, similar to a match_all query.
