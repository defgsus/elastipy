doc: |
    Returns documents based on a provided query string, using a parser with a strict syntax.

    This query uses a [syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax) to parse and split the provided query string based on operators, such as AND or NOT. The query then [analyzes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html) each split text independently before returning matching documents.

    You can use the query_string query to create a complex search that includes wildcard characters, searches across multiple fields, and more. While versatile, the query is strict and returns an error if the query string includes any invalid syntax.

    Warning:
        Because it returns an error for any invalid syntax, we don’t recommend using the query_string query for search boxes.

        If you don’t need to support a query syntax, consider using the [match](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query.html) query. If you need the features of a query syntax, use the [simple_query_string](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html) query, which is less strict.
parameters:
    query:
        type: str
        required: True
        doc: |
            Query string you wish to parse and use for search. See [Query string syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax).
    default_field:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Default field you wish to search if no field is provided in the query string.

            Defaults to the `index.query.default_field` index setting, which has a default value of `*`. The `*` value extracts all fields that are eligible for term queries and filters the metadata fields. All extracted fields are then combined to build a query if no prefix is specified.

            Searching across all eligible fields does not include nested documents. Use a nested query to search those documents.

            For mappings with a large number of fields, searching across all eligible fields could be expensive.

            There is a limit on the number of fields that can be queried at once. It is defined by the indices.query.bool.max_clause_count search setting, which defaults to 1024.
    allow_leading_wildcard:
        type: bool
        default: True
        doc: |
            If true, the wildcard characters * and ? are allowed as the first character of the query string. Defaults to true.
    analyze_wildcard:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            If true, the query attempts to analyze wildcard terms in the query string. Defaults to false.
    analyzer:
        type: str
        doc: |
            [Analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html) used to convert text in the query string into tokens. Defaults to the [index-time analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/specify-analyzer.html#specify-index-time-analyzer) mapped for the default_field. If no analyzer is mapped, the index’s default analyzer is used.
    auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query:
        type: bool
        doc: |
            If true, [match phrase](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query-phrase.html) queries are automatically created for multi-term synonyms. Defaults to true. See [Synonyms and the query_string query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-synonyms) for an example.
    boost:
        type: float
        default: 1.
        doc: |
            Floating point number used to decrease or increase the [relevance scores](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-filter-context.html#relevance-scores) of the query. Defaults to 1.0.

            Boost values are relative to the default value of 1.0. A boost value between 0 and 1.0 decreases the relevance score. A value greater than 1.0 increases the relevance score.
    default_operator:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Default boolean logic used to interpret text in the query string if no operators are specified. Valid values are:
                OR (Default)
                    For example, a query string of capital of Hungary is interpreted as capital OR of OR Hungary.
                AND
                    For example, a query string of capital of Hungary is interpreted as capital AND of AND Hungary.
    enable_position_increments:
        type: bool
        default: True
        doc: |
            If true, enable position increments in queries constructed from a query_string search. Defaults to true.
    fields:
        type: Sequence[str]
        doc: |
            Array of fields you wish to search.

            You can use this parameter query to search across multiple fields. See [Search multiple fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-multi-field).
    fuzziness:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Maximum edit distance allowed for matching. See Fuzziness for valid values and more information. See Fuzziness in the match query for an example.
    fuzzy_max_expansions:
        type: int
        default: 50
        doc: |
            Maximum number of terms to which the query will expand. Defaults to 50. 
    fuzzy_prefix_length:
        type: int
        default: 0
        doc: |
            Number of beginning characters left unchanged for fuzzy matching. Defaults to 0. 
    fuzzy_transpositions:
        type: bool
        default: True
        doc: |
            If true, edits for fuzzy matching include transpositions of two adjacent characters (ab → ba). Defaults to true.
    lenient:
        type: bool
        default: False
        doc: |
            If true, format-based errors, such as providing a text query value for a numeric field, are ignored. Defaults to false. 
    max_determinized_states:
        type: int
        default: 10000
        doc: |
            Maximum number of [automaton states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) required for the query. Default is 10000.

            Elasticsearch uses Apache Lucene internally to parse regular expressions. Lucene converts each regular expression to a finite automaton containing a number of determinized states.

            You can use this parameter to prevent that conversion from unintentionally consuming too many resources. You may need to increase this limit to run complex regular expressions.
    minimum_should_match:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Minimum number of clauses that must match for a document to be returned. See the minimum_should_match parameter for valid values and more information.
    quote_analyzer:
        type: str
        doc: |
            [Analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html) used to convert quoted text in the query string into tokens. Defaults to the search_quote_analyzer mapped for the default_field.

            For quoted text, this parameter overrides the analyzer specified in the analyzer parameter.
    phrase_slop:
        type: int
        default: 0
        doc: |
            Maximum number of positions allowed between matching tokens for phrases. Defaults to 0. If 0, exact phrase matches are required. Transposed terms have a slop of 2.
    quote_field_suffix:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Suffix appended to quoted text in the query string.

            You can use this suffix to use a different analysis method for exact matches. See [Mixing exact search with stemming](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mixing-exact-search-with-stemming.html).
    rewrite:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Method used to rewrite the query. For valid values and more information, see the [rewrite parameter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-term-rewrite.html).
    time_zone:
        type: str
        doc: |
            [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UTC_time_offsets) or [IANA time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) used to convert date values in the query string to UTC.

            Valid values are ISO 8601 UTC offsets, such as +01:00 or -08:00, and IANA time zone IDs, such as America/Los_Angeles.

            Note: The time_zone parameter does not affect the [date math](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/common-options.html#date-math) value of now. now is always the current system time in UTC. However, the time_zone parameter does convert dates calculated using now and [date math rounding](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/common-options.html#date-math). For example, the time_zone parameter will convert a value of now/d.
