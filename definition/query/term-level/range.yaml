    Returns documents that contain terms within a provided range.

    When the <field> parameter is a date field data type, you can use date math with the 'gt', 'gte', 'lt' and 'lte' parameters.

parameters:
    field:
        type: str
        required: True
        top_level: True
        doc: |
            Field you wish to search.
    gt:
        type: Union[str, int, float, date, datetime]
        doc: |
            Greater than.
    gte:
        type: Union[str, int, float, date, datetime]
        doc: |
            Greater than or equal to.
    lt:
        type: Union[str, int, float, date, datetime]
        doc: |
            Less than.
    lte:

    format:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Date format used to convert date values in the query.

            By default, Elasticsearch uses the date format provided in the <field>'s mapping. This value overrides that mapping format.

            For valid syntax see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-date-format.html
    relation:
        type: str
        default: INTERSECTS
        doc: |
            Indicates how the range query matches values for range fields. Valid values are:
                INTERSECTS (Default)
                    Matches documents with a range field value that intersects the query’s range.
                CONTAINS
                    Matches documents with a range field value that entirely contains the query’s range.
                WITHIN
                    Matches documents with a range field value entirely within the query’s range.
    time_zone:
        type: str
        doc: |
            Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset or IANA time zone used to convert date values in the query to UTC.

            Valid values are ISO 8601 UTC offsets, such as +01:00 or -08:00, and IANA time zone IDs, such as America/Los_Angeles.
    boost:
        type: float
        doc: |
            Floating point number used to decrease or increase the relevance scores of a query. Defaults to 1.0.

            You can use the boost parameter to adjust relevance scores for searches containing two or more queries.

            Boost values are relative to the default value of 1.0. A boost value between 0 and 1.0 decreases the relevance score. A value greater than 1.0 increases the relevance score.
