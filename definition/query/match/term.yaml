doc: |
    Returns documents that contain an exact term in a provided field.
    
    You can use the term query to find documents based on a precise value such as a price, a product ID, or a username.
parameters:
    field:
        type: str
        required: True
        top_level: True
        doc: |
            Field you wish to search.
    value:
        type: str
        required: True
        doc: |
            Term you wish to find in the provided <field>. To return a document, the term must exactly match the field value, including whitespace and capitalization.
    boost:
        type: float
        doc: |
            Floating point number used to decrease or increase the relevance scores of a query. Defaults to 1.0.
            
            You can use the boost parameter to adjust relevance scores for searches containing two or more queries.
            
            Boost values are relative to the default value of 1.0. A boost value between 0 and 1.0 decreases the relevance score. A value greater than 1.0 increases the relevance score.
    case_insensitive:
        type: bool
        doc: |
            allows ASCII case insensitive matching of the value with the indexed field values when set to true. Default is false which means the case sensitivity of matching depends on the underlying fieldâ€™s mapping.
