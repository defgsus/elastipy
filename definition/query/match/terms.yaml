doc: |
    Returns documents that contain one or more exact terms in a provided field.
    
    The terms query is the same as the term query, except you can search for multiple values.
parameters:
    field:
        type: str
        required: True
        top_level: True
        doc: |
            Field you wish to search.
    value:
        type: str
        required: True
        doc: |
            The value of this parameter is an array of terms you wish to find in the provided field. To return a document, one or more terms must exactly match a field value, including whitespace and capitalization.
            
            By default, Elasticsearch limits the terms query to a maximum of 65,536 terms. You can change this limit using the index.max_terms_count setting.
    boost:
        type: float
        doc: |
            Floating point number used to decrease or increase the relevance scores of a query. Defaults to 1.0.
            
            You can use the boost parameter to adjust relevance scores for searches containing two or more queries.
            
            Boost values are relative to the default value of 1.0. A boost value between 0 and 1.0 decreases the relevance score. A value greater than 1.0 increases the relevance score.
