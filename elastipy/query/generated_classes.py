        :param field: str
            Field you wish to search.

        :param query: Union[str, int, float, bool]
            Text, number, boolean value or date you wish to find in the provided
            <field>.

            The match query analyzes any provided text before performing a search.
            This means the match query can search text fields for analyzed tokens
            rather than an exact term.

        :param auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query: bool
            If true, match phrase queries are automatically created for multi-term
            synonyms. Defaults to true.

        :param fuzziness: Optional[str]
            Maximum edit distance allowed for matching. See Fuzziness for valid
            values and more information. See Fuzziness in the match query for an
            example.

        :param max_expansions: int
            Maximum number of terms to which the query will expand. Defaults to 50. 

        :param prefix_length: int
            Number of beginning characters left unchanged for fuzzy matching.
            Defaults to 0. 

        :param fuzzy_transpositions: bool
            If true, edits for fuzzy matching include transpositions of two adjacent
            characters (ab â†’ ba). Defaults to true.

        :param fuzzy_rewrite: Optional[str]
            Method used to rewrite the query. See the rewrite parameter for valid
            values and more information.

            If the fuzziness parameter is not 0, the match query uses a
            fuzzy_rewrite method of top_terms_blended_freqs_${max_expansions} by
            default.

        :param lenient: bool
            If true, format-based errors, such as providing a text query value for a
            numeric field, are ignored. Defaults to false. 

        :param operator: Optional[str]
            Boolean logic used to interpret text in the query value. Valid values
            are:
                OR (Default)
                    For example, a query value of capital of Hungary is interpreted
                    as capital OR of OR Hungary. 
                AND
                    For example, a query value of capital of Hungary is interpreted
                    as capital AND of AND Hungary. 

        :param minimum_should_match: Optional[str]
            Minimum number of clauses that must match for a document to be returned.
            See the minimum_should_match parameter for valid values and more
            information.

        :param zero_terms_query: str
            Indicates whether no documents are returned if the analyzer removes all
            tokens, such as when using a stop filter. Valid values are:
                none (Default)
                    No documents are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens.
