            The match query analyzes any provided text before performing a search.

            Maximum edit distance allowed for matching. See Fuzziness for valid
            values and more information. See Fuzziness in the match query for an
            example.

            Maximum number of terms to which the query will expand. Defaults to 50.

            Defaults to 0.

        :param fuzzy_transpositions: bool
            If true, edits for fuzzy matching include transpositions of two adjacent
            characters (ab â†’ ba). Defaults to true.

        :param fuzzy_rewrite: Optional[str]
            Method used to rewrite the query. See the rewrite parameter for valid
            values and more information.

            If the fuzziness parameter is not 0, the match query uses a
            fuzzy_rewrite method of top_terms_blended_freqs_${max_expansions} by
            default.

        :param lenient: bool
            If true, format-based errors, such as providing a text query value for a
            numeric field, are ignored. Defaults to false.

        :param operator: Optional[str]
            Boolean logic used to interpret text in the query value. Valid values
            are:
                OR (Default)
                    For example, a query value of capital of Hungary is interpreted
                    as capital OR of OR Hungary. 
                AND

            Minimum number of clauses that must match for a document to be returned.
            See the minimum_should_match parameter for valid values and more
            information.

        :param zero_terms_query: str
            Indicates whether no documents are returned if the analyzer removes all
            tokens, such as when using a stop filter. Valid values are:
                none (Default)

                    Matches documents with a range field value that entirely
                    contains the queryâ€™s range.
                WITHIN
                    Matches documents with a range field value entirely within the

        :param time_zone: Optional[str]
            Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset or IANA time zone used to
